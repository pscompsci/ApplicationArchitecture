# Base Banking Application

This application was initially developed as a series of tasks in Object-Oriented
Programming at Deakin University in T1/2020.

The application was specifically designed to incorporate the four main principles
of object-oriented development, including:

* Abstraction
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism

It achieves those goals, however the implementation isn't perfect, and 
imperfections have been deliberately left in the included code, which allows many
of the issues to be addressed in the different architectural approaches implemented
in the repository.
